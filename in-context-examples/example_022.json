  "reasoning": "Step 1: Primitives are six points, rays from O to each, and textual labels with no arcs or circles.  \nStep 2: Key constraints: all rays share vertex O, OA vertical and OB horizontal, B,N,C vertically aligned.  \nStep 3: Coordinates use explicit Cartesian values, placing O at (0,0) and other points by fixed coordinates.  \nStep 4: Construction order: declare coordinates first, then draw straight rays from O to each defined point.  \nStep 5: Add node labels after drawing, using anchor hints like above left, right, above right and below left.  \nStep 6: Extras: no fills or arrows or grids are used, only a scale parameter set to one.  \nStep 7: Render details: rays are finite segments from O, and labels placed last to remain on top."
