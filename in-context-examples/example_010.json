  "reasoning": "Step 1: Primitives are four points, two horizontal lines, and three segments from P to base points.\nStep 2: Constraints: A, B, C are collinear on the bottom line and P lies on the top horizontal.\nStep 3: Coordinates use fixed Cartesian positions: P at (0,3), A at (0,0), B at (1.5,0), C at (3.5,0).\nStep 4: Horizontal lines drawn across x from -1 to 4 at y=3 and y=0 to set baselines.\nStep 5: Construction order: define coordinates, draw horizontals, connect P to A,B,C, then place labels.\nStep 6: Labels placed with node anchors above P and below A, B, C for readability.\nStep 7: Extras: no fills, arrows, grids, or decorations; simple strokes and scale factor one used."
