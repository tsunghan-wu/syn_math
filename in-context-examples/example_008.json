  "reasoning": "Step 1: The diagram uses points O, A, B, C, D, E connected by straight segments radiating from O.  \nStep 2: Endpoints lie on orthogonal axes: A,B on x; C,D on y; E on vertical z at O.  \nStep 3: Distances are unit-length parameters w, d, h set to 1, so radial segments share equal lengths.  \nStep 4: Coordinates are fixed Cartesian positions derived from those parameters, not polar or intersection constructions.  \nStep 5: Construction order: define parameters, assign coordinates, draw thick radial lines, then place vertex labels.  \nStep 6: Styling applies a 3D view transform and scaling, with rounded joins and thick stroked lines.  \nStep 7: No fills, arrows, grids, or additional decorations are used, and labels are anchored near each vertex."
