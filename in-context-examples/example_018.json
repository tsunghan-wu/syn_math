  "reasoning": "Step 1: Primitives are points, straight segments, dashed and solid edges, and labeled node markers.  \nStep 2: Constraints: rectangular base, P above its center, E on BP, F on BC, and G halfway vertically.  \nStep 3: Use parameters w,l,h with base at z=0; P at (w/2,l/2,h), E,F by interpolation, G half height.  \nStep 4: Construction begins by defining numeric parameters and base corner coordinates A, B, C, D on z=0.  \nStep 5: Next define apex P, compute E as midpoint of BP, F along BC at 30%, and G at mid height.  \nStep 6: Draw order: render dashed (hidden) segments first, then thick visible edges, and the solid connector C–E.  \nStep 7: Extras: apply dashed and thick styles, place node labels, and set the 3D view rotation and scale."
