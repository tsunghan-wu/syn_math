  "reasoning": "Step 1: Primitives include labeled points, two rectangles (polygons), straight segments, a dashed connector, and node labels.  \nStep 2: Rectangles impose perpendicular adjacent sides and parallel opposite sides; A is common vertex to both rectangles.  \nStep 3: Use fixed Cartesian coordinates: A at origin, D left, B up, C accordingly, mirrored rectangle right.  \nStep 4: Define points and draw original rectangle ABCD first, then construct reflected rectangle AB'C'D' adjacent to A.  \nStep 5: Draw diagonals A-C and A-C', and dashed connector C–C'.  \nStep 6: Apply thick stroke for rectangles and diagonals, dashed style for fold, and position node labels.  \nStep 7: No fills or axes used, only line styling, scale set, and precise coordinate placement."
