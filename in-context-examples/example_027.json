  "reasoning": "Step 1: Primitives are points A, B, C, D, F, E and segments AB, AC, BC, BD, AD, CF.  \nStep 2: Constraints: F is on AB at 0.6, and E is AD intersect CF.  \nStep 3: Coordinates: place A(2,3), B(-2,1), C(3,-1), D(-1,-0.5) as fixed Cartesian points.  \nStep 4: Parameter: compute F by linear interpolation along AB with parameter 0.6 from A toward B.  \nStep 5: Construction order: define coordinates, then draw segments AB, AC, BC, BD, AD, CF, naming AD and CF.  \nStep 6: Compute E as the named-path intersection of AD and CF, then place node E at that intersection.  \nStep 7: Extras: add text labels with relative anchors and intentionally omit fills, arrows, grids, or decorations."
