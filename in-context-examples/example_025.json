  "reasoning": "Step 1: Primitives are 3D points, line segments, polygon faces, a blue triangle, dashed segments, and labels.  \nStep 2: Constraints: base and top share vertical edges; Q midpoint of D'C', E and F on AB.  \nStep 3: Use fixed base coordinates, top vertices with z=2, Q via midpoint, E and F fixed.  \nStep 4: Define base points first, then lift to top vertices, then compute Q, E, and F.  \nStep 5: Draw dashed back edges, thick visible edges, verticals, then blue triangle Q‑A'‑E and dashed A'‑F‑Q.  \nStep 6: Add gray dashed styling for hidden edges, blue styling for internal geometry, and anchored labels.  \nStep 7: Apply a 3D view rotation and scaling to project the cube into 2D for final rendering."
