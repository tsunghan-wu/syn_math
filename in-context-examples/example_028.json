  "reasoning": "Step 1: Primitives: a circle, three circumference points A,B,C, triangle segments, center O, radii, point marker, labels.  \nStep 2: Constraints: A, B, C lie on the same circle; triangle ABC edges connect those points; OA and OC are radii.  \nStep 3: Coordinates: fix O at origin, define radius R as parameter, place A,B,C by polar angles on circle.  \nStep 4: Compute specific angles: set A at 126.87°, B at 210°, and C at 40°, each distance R from O.  \nStep 5: Construction order: draw circle first, plot A,B,C, draw triangle edges, then draw radii OA and OC, fill O.  \nStep 6: Extras: simple filled dot for O, textual labels around points, no grid or arrows, minimal decorative styling."
