  "reasoning": "Step 1: Primitives are eight 3D points, solid and dashed edges, two quadrilateral faces, and labels.  \nStep 2: Constraints: top and base are parallel rectangles, vertical edges parallel, diagonal plane through A,B,C1,D1.  \nStep 3: Coordinates use parameters w,d,h with rectangular base coordinates and z-height for top vertices.  \nStep 4: Construction order: define base and top coordinates, draw hidden dashed edges, then draw solid visible edges.  \nStep 5: Finally add vertex labels with anchor directions and keep redundant edge draws for logical clarity.  \nStep 6: Extras include 3D view angles, overall scale, line join/cap styling, and dashed styling for hidden edges."
