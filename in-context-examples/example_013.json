  "reasoning": "Step 1: Primitives are a circle, points A B C, triangle edges, center point, and labels.  \nStep 2: Constraints: A B C lie on the circle, forming an inscribed (approx equilateral) triangle.  \nStep 3: Coordinates placed with O at origin, radius 2, and fixed Cartesian coordinates for A B C.  \nStep 4: Construction order: define center and vertices, draw the circle, then connect vertices to form triangle.  \nStep 5: Add a small filled dot at O and place textual node labels near A B C and O.  \nStep 6: No additional decorations, grids, axes, arrows, or fills beyond simple strokes and the filled center dot."
