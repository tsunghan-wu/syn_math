  "reasoning": "Step 1: Primitives are five points, three triangle edges, two crossing segments, and labels.  \nStep 2: D and E are midpoints of AB and AC respectively, and BE and CD intersect inside.  \nStep 3: Place A,B,C at fixed coordinates and compute D,E by 0.5 interpolation (midpoints).  \nStep 4: Define coordinates first, compute midpoints next, draw triangle edges, then draw BE and CD.  \nStep 5: Add node labels with anchors: A above, B left, C right, D left, E right.  \nStep 6: No fills, arrows, or grids; simple black stroked lines with scale set to one."
