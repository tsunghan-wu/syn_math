  "reasoning": "Step 1: Primitives are points A, B, C, D, triangle edges AB, BC, CA, and segment BD.  \nStep 2: Key constraints: D is collinear on AC and lies on segment AC, BC is horizontal.  \nStep 3: Coordinate strategy uses fixed Cartesian coordinates given explicitly as numeric (x,y) pairs.  \nStep 4: Construction order begins by defining coordinates A, B, C, D before any drawing operations.  \nStep 5: Then draw triangle edges AB, BC, CA, followed by drawing segment BD between B and D.  \nStep 6: Finally add textual labels with positional anchors; no fills, arrows, grids, or extra decorations."
