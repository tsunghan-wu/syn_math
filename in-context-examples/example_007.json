  "reasoning": "Step 1: Primitives: three points, triangle segments, circular angle arcs, dashed vertical guide lines, and labels.  \nStep 2: Constraints: AC horizontal, B lies at intersection of a C-ray at 30° and an A-ray at 135°, giving 60° and 45°.  \nStep 3: Coordinates: place C at (0,0) and A at (4,0), create rays using polar directions with fixed length.  \nStep 4: Construction order: define C and A, create named ray paths, intersect them to get B, then draw the triangle.  \nStep 5: Angle arcs: compute ray angles with atan2 from vectors (B−C) and (B−A), draw arcs from vertical to those angles.  \nStep 6: Extras: dashed vertical \"north\" guides at A and C with short lower ticks and Japanese '北' labels above.  \nStep 7: Final touches: render triangle thick and position point labels C below-left, A below-right, and B above."
