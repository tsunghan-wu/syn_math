  "reasoning": "Step 1: Primitives include coordinate axes, a circle, several named points, an extended line, and connecting segments.\n\nStep 2: Key constraints: A and B are on the circle centered at T, and A, P, M, B are collinear.\n\nStep 3: Coordinate strategy places T at (1,0) with radius 1.5, A and B via polar angles 120° and 300°, and O at origin.\n\nStep 4: Compute A_ext and B_ext by extending AB outward, and compute P and M by linear interpolation along AB.\n\nStep 5: Construction order begins by drawing axes, defining T and the circle, then placing A and B on the circle.\n\nStep 6: Next compute extended endpoints, compute P and M, draw the extended AB line, then draw segments O–P and O–M and add labels.\n\nStep 7: Extras: arrowed axes, positional node labels, no fills, simple stroke styling, and overall picture scaling."
