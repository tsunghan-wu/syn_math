  "reasoning": "Step 1: Primitives: two horizontal lines forming a strip, vertical edges, triangle polygon, intersection point, and angle pics.  \nStep 2: Constraints: A on top line, AB meets bottom at D, and AB perpendicular AC at A.  \nStep 3: Coordinates: top y=1 and bottom y=0.4 from x=0 to 5, A and B fixed, C rotated.  \nStep 4: Construction: draw strip and edges, place A and B, compute C and D, then draw triangle.  \nStep 5: Add right-angle square at A and filled angle sectors labeled \"1\" and \"2\".  \nStep 6: Styling: thick lines for strip and triangle, angle radii set, gray fills, and small label shifts.  \nStep 7: Use endpoints R=(5,1) and L=(0,0.4) as reference rays for the two angle pics."
