  "reasoning": "Step 1: Primitives are points A,B,C,D,E,F,H, polygon rectangle, solid and dashed segments.  \nStep 2: Constraints: ABCD is a rectangle, AB⊥BC, E lies on CD, F lies on BC, H is AE∩DF.  \nStep 3: Use fixed coordinates for A,B,C,D; set E as CD midpoint and F at BC 75%.  \nStep 4: Construction order: define rectangle points, compute E and F, find H as intersection, then draw segments.  \nStep 5: Styling: thick lines for rectangle and main segments, dashed for AE and EF, no fills or arrows.  \nStep 6: Finalize by placing node labels with relative alignments around each point and labeling H."
