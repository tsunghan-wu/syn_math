  "reasoning": "Step 1: Primitives: four vertices, square edges, two diagonals, two internal segments, point markers and labels.  \nStep 2: Constraints: ABCD is a square, BC and CD midpoints at M and N, diagonals intersect centrally.  \nStep 3: Coordinates use fixed Cartesian points: A(0,0), B(4,0), C(4,4), D(0,4), with M and N as midpoints.  \nStep 4: Construct coordinates first, draw the square, then add diagonals AC and BD, then segments AM and BN.  \nStep 5: Place textual labels for A,B,C,D and label M right and N above after drawing.  \nStep 6: Extras: no fills or arrows, simple stroked lines, scale one, and no grid or decorations."
