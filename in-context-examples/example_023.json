  "reasoning": "Step 1: Primitives: circle centered at O, points D, B, C, A, P, and segments DC, PB, PC drawn.  \nStep 2: Key constraints: D, B, C lie on the circle, A and C are circle intersections, P, O, C collinear.  \nStep 3: Coordinate strategy: O at origin radius 2, D and B placed fixed, P on OD extension, compute intersections for C and A.  \nStep 4: Construction order: define O and circle, place D and B, position P, compute intersections C and A, then draw segments.  \nStep 5: Marking and labels: fill O as a small dot and label O, D, B, C, A, P with appropriate offsets.  \nStep 6: Extras: use named paths and intersection computations, small filled points, and no grid, axes, or arrows."
